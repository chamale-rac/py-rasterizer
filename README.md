# 🐍 py-rasterizer 🖼️ AKA Lab 2: Shaders

Welcome to the py-rasterizer repository! This Python-based implementation is a powerful (giño giño...) tool for rasterizing BMP files.

## 🚀 How to execute it?

Simply run the next commands:

``` bash
cd src
```

``` bash
python app.py
```

That's all, now check the results on models on [./out/](./out/)

## 🎭 Show off

| shader            | result |
|-------------------|--------|
| fractal shader    |        |
| invert shader     |        |
| camouflage shader |        |

🧠 Reminder: can find the original .bpm renders at [./out/](./out/)
